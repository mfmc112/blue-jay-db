# blue-jay-db
I was bored and wanted to know what were the challenges of creating a DB. I decided to create my own from scratch and apply what I know and learn what I needed to get it done nicely.

I will add more information later. 

## TODOs
Return the asset when search
Add more types of indexes as needed like suffix maybe a combination of preffix and suffix
Create kind of splunk to get data out of the log and display as a graphic or something like that (maybe different project)
Update this readme to have example of usage
